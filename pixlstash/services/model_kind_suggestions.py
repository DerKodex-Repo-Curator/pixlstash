"""The kind a shelf model's workflows load it as, offered to the owner (#1962).

The shelf files a model from its header, its folder and its parameter count,
and some files beat all three: a GGUF text encoder in a flat folder stays
Unclassified. A workflow that loads the file says what it is - ``clip_name`` on
a text-encoder loader, ``vae_name`` on a VAE loader
(:func:`~pixlstash.services.workflow_identity.model_fix_kind`) - and the
recorded workflows already store which field names which file
(``workflow_recipe_asset``), so the answer is a lookup, not a rescan.

**An offer, never a write.** Nothing here touches ``model.file_kind``; the shelf
shows the kind beside the one it holds and the owner files it. And only when the
evidence agrees: every recorded workflow that loads the model loads it as the
same kind. One that loads it in another slot (a LoRA, an upscaler) or as a
vision encoder, or whose loader class cannot
be read, disagrees.

``model.file_kind_decided`` is the owner's say: set by any kind they pick and
by "Don't suggest", cleared by "Suggest a kind again". The suggestion is still
computed for a decided row, so the shelf can offer the way back.
